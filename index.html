                <p>Mabuhay! The Department of Tourism in partnership with the Creative Tourism Network, based in
                    Barcelona, Spain is spearheading the development of Creative Tourism in the Philippines. As Creative
                    Tourism is a form of travel that places an emphasis on engaging tourists with “co-creation’ with
                    local culture, arts, and heritage at the forefront, this type of tourism has gained popularity in
                    recent years as more and more travelers seek meaningful and authentic experiences that go beyond
                    traditional tourist attractions. The Philippines with its magnitude of cultural assets, traditions
                    and experiences can definitely take the global stage in Creative Tourism.

            <div class="main-desc-btn">
                <p>The Philippine Creative Tourism Congress is set to unfold in the dynamic and inspiring Art District,
                    nestled in the heart of Bacolod City. This contemporary art space has emerged as a catalyst for
                    broadening the discourse and possibilities within the realm of art.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Established 18 years ago, the Art District originated as an artist-run selling gallery in 2005 with
                    the vision of establishing a market accessible to Negrense artists. Over time, its focus has evolved
                    from a market-oriented perspective to nurturing the growth of young artists in Negros Occidental.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Plenary sessions will take place in the district’s main gallery hall, the vibrant Orange
                    Project, while breakout sessions are slated for distinctive spaces such as the <em>Naranja
                        Residency,
                        Block 17, The Grey Room, and various other areas</em> that truly encapsulate a spirit of
                    creativity and
                    artistic expression.
