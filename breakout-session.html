                <span>This session embarks on a journey of art, tradition, and culture with the Panay Bukidnon School of Living 
                    Traditions (SLT) in Calinog, Iloilo, implemented by the Buhi Nga Palanublion Tribal Organization. Immerse yourself 
                    in the artful craft of Panubok Embroidery, the traditional embroidery of the Panay Bukidnon people of the Visayas, 
                    and explore how Panubok designs and patterns intricately represent nature, characters, and events from the 
                    Sugidanon epic. This presentation delves into how a traditional craft can engage tourists through Creative Tourism, 
                    offering not just a visual feast but an educational experience that highlights how visitors can actively 
                    participate in supporting local products while gaining insights into the rich cultural heritage woven into the 
                    fabric of Panubok Embroidery.</span>
