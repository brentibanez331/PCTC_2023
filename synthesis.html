</span></a>
                
                <p>A Message from Undersecretary Verna C. Buensuseco</p><br><br>
                <span>Inspired by the best practices we have learned and heard for the last two days, I can see and feel that we 
have at some point succeeded with our mission to enjoin everyone individually and collectively, hoping that from now on, 
we strongly commit to supporting and advocating for our Country’s Creative Tourism. <br><br>

Creative Tourism is a new concept <br><br>

We have heard this term for the past two days and see how this is quite revolutionary, since what we are doing now is reshaping the way 
we live and work. It tells us that this is not just about the products we produce; it's about ideas, innovation, and the power of 
creativity. Just like what Ms. Caroline Couret, CEO of Creative Tourism Network emphasized in her presentation on Day 1 of the 
Plenary Session, we do not just create and establish destinations, we should also aim to make destinations creative and friendly, 
places that will immerse and allow tourists to co-create and co-participate. <br><br>
Cong. Toff De Venecia also  mentioned during the panel discussion on Day two, that as we gear towards the culmination of a creative 
tourism, we do not only think about the culture and the arts, but we also think about its socioeconomic advantage, providing jobs and 
wider opportunities for  our local artists and artisans. Because just like how our three creative cities (Iloilo, Cebu and Baguio) 
were already recognized, I am sure that we are deeply inspired by how these creative cities were able to put their stories out there, 
making it globally marketable.<br><br>
Authenticity and Community Involvement by showcasing local culture, history and   traditions <br><br>
We also have the opportunity to showcase, Philippine’s very own DNA, its authenticity through different cultural, agricultural, 
traditional, historical and gastronomical products. From coffee and tourism championing our coffee culture to the sweet creativity 
of Iloilo’s tablea and many more that surely unveiled our country’s culinary treasure - all rooted in the stories of our people, 
the place and its historical practices. (pause) I mean with all the curated lunches and snacks we had yesterday and today, is such a 
loud proof that our gastronomic scene is thriving. <br><br>
Aside from food, we also had the chance to flaunt during the breakout sessions, our indigenous art practices such as weaving in 
Western Visayas, embroidery in Bukidnon, wearable art in Davao, even with crafts and folk arts of Baguio and many many more. We are 
fortunate that all these came in handy for us to see for the past two days. <br><br>
Culture is part of our everyday life<br><br>
This might be all new to us, but the beauty of what we are doing right now is, that we are doing it all together, 
in the same space and rhythm. This will be our everyday mission, just like what Cong. Kiko Benitez said in his presentation 
this morning, that culture is a practice of everyday cultivation, just like how artists, specialists, artisans provide our 
narratives through sensations, performance and images. It is a reflection of who we are as a local community. Culture is about people 
and what we do. Creative Tourism is as simple as coffee being part of our everyday life, and conversations 
Support and Partnerships <br><br>
I also love hearing perspectives from our participants, how they have shared their own initiatives in their own local communities. 
I heard during our panel sessions how storytelling was utilized as a tool to educate, especially to the young people which affirms 
UNESCO’s understanding of Creative Tourism as what shared by Mr. Victor P. Estrella on Day 1 Plenary Session and he quote 
“Creative tourism involves educational, emotional, social, and participative interaction with the place, its living culture, 
and the people who live there. Visitors, when they visit, will feel like a citizen”. <br><br>
Even with simple initiatives can already impact the community, how much more if they get the support that they need? 
Today, I am very happy that this event is gathered by both public and private institutions since this is our collaborative 
effort to work together, strengthen the support and to empower especially those who are in the private sector.
Love Creative Tourism, Love the Philippines<br><br>
To conclude this, I would just like to emphasize what Secretary Christina Garcia - Frasco shared in her keynote presentation
 yesterday, she said that “Our tourists will become witnesses and participants in telling the world The Filipino Story, perpetuating 
the good news of all there is to Love about the Philippines, and ensuring livelihood and employment in return.” This statement 
is such a powerful “pabaon” as we go home tomorrow,  to remind us to actively engage with and share our positive experiences in the 
Philippines, with the understanding that our actions contribute not only to a positive global image but also to the economic prosperity 
of our local communities when visited. <br><br>
So may I invite everyone to again say with pride this tagline from the words of our Tourism Secretary yesterday, 
“Love Creative Tourism, Love the Philippines!”<br><br>
