                    companies - - The Sandbox Collective and 9Works Theatrical - - he has trained the
                    attention of the House to the needs of those who valiantly work to promote Philippine arts
                    and culture, and who showcase in every form the magnificence of Filipino artistry.
                    He has championed the development of the Philippine creative industries and principally
                    authored Republic Act 11904 or the Philippine Creative Industries Development Act,
                    a landmark legislation which seeks to promote economic growth, nation-building, and
                    creativity, with the end-goal of making the Philippines the number one creative economy
                    in the ASEAN region.
