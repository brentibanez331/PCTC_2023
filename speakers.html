                        Under her leadership, the Philippines recorded 2.65 million arrivals in 2022 and generating over

                        Quote:
                        “Let us work together in giving our many creative industries the support and recognition
                        they deserve. A creative future should not be left to chance. It is planned, not dreamed.
                        It is organized, not whimsical. It is taken seriously, and not treated as an afterthought.
                        After all, a creative future is safe, sustainable, and happy – for all. Because truly
                        #TheFutureIsCreative.”
